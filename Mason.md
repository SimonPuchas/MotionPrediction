Familiarize yourself with the LSTM_testing.py script and just train it using different hyperparameters. Meaning change the learning rate and see how the model performes, or change the batch size, change the amount of hidden layers, etc. 

You can use the wandb plugin, which is initialized in the beginning of the script and it logs the training and validation loss at the end of the training and validation loop respectively. Don't save the model for now, so just leave the code part which i deactivated at the bottom as it is. 

You can aswell try to implement the functionality to use the test part of our dataset to test the models performance after training it. There is something like that in the Custom_LSTM.ipynb file from Sam at the bottom.

You can create files in the TestScripts folder as well if you want to test some stuff, or create your own folder where you store the stuff. And also try to push the changes you do to the git repository. You can implement the git repository into your VS code if you haven't already done it. If you need help with that you can just ask ChatGPT or you ask us.
